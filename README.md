# Predictive-Shiny-app
N-gram next word prediction model 

This App is written in R and presented as a Shiny webapp for Coursera/Johns Hopkins University Data Science Capstone project.  The goal of the project is to develop a statistical n-gram model to predict next word. Performance and accuracy are studied and achieved to a degree.  The Shiny app was created in RStudio and can be executed from that environment. A wide non-technical audience is targeted. Response time is equivalent to a generic web app. The UI design is simple to encourage user to focus and not to distract. User is challenged to think of phrases in English as input to see whether or not the algorithm is interesting, or entertaining or ultimately useful. Data here has been scrubbed, sampled & tokenized, in dictionary format. The steps of the overall Capstone project were to get & clean the data, divide it into words, create training and test samples & run various classification models to compare accuracy statistics after each run.
